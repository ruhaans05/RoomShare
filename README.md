# Boiler RoomShare


Boiler RoomShare is a Python Flask-based application that Purdue roommates to manage their costs through a room group, and settle finances after they are paid. What makes this app unique is that it has data on the costs of items from the local Target, and soon Walmart and Sam's Club, which prevent roommates from upcharging others. Essentially, costs will be verified. 

This app includes a GUI and SQLite database to store information.
